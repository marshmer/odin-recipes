<h2>An Italian Classic</h2>
    <p>Chicken combined with bread, hearty pasta sauce, and gooey provolone and parmesan cheeses 
        to make an Italian staple on the go!
    </p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F, and spray baking pan with vegetable oil spray.</li>
        <li>Place frozen chicken fillets on pan and bake for 10-12 minutes. Turn chicken, sprinkle 
            2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese on each fillet, and bake until crispy (10-12 mins).
        </li>
        <li>Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions. Open each portion and place garlic side 
            up on a baking sheet. Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 mins.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble, place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce 
            or marinara sauce on top of the chicken, and lay a slice of provolone on top of the sauce. 
            Place 3 basil leaves, or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half.
        </li>
        <li>Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5-8 mins. 
            Unwrap and serve warm.
