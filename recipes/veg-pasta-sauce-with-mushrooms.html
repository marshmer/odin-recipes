<h2>Great to use on your favorite Italian dish!</h2>
<p>Use fresh mushrooms in place of meat to create a hearty and healthy pasta sauce alternative. This 
    goes great with our Pizzaghetti or Chicken Parm Sub recipes!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>1/2 pound fresh baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 pound fresh button mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry red wine, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano</li>
    <li>1 (23 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar, or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-heat. Add portobello mushrooms, button mushrooms, and 
        onion. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their 
        juices and onion is soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Pour in wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
    <li>Pour in diced tomatoes and cook, stirring, until liquid has slightly reduced, about 5 mins. 
        Add pasta sauce, garlic, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. 
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to low and simmer, uncovered, until 
        flavors have blended and desired thickness has been reached, about 15 mins. Stir sauce occasionally.
